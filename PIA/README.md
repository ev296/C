# HOROSCOPE

## INTRODUCTION

For my Integrative Product of Learning, I program a little dynamic horoscope, you can choose to consult your horoscope of the day or another option. 
First, you have to join your birthday date and the program will give you your zodiac sign by default. Then there will be three options you can choose from:

1. The traditional horoscope of the day tells you the predictions of some areas of your life depending on your zodiac sign.

2. Your strengths and weaknesses according to your sign.

3. Know which is your compatibility with the other signs.

## CONTENT
This program is recreational, the user can consult the sections as often as he wants or leave the program.

It responds correctly to data errors, showing the error and giving you another chance to recapture. This with an unlimited number of times.

It provides the information or advertised horoscope randomly, so it will be changing the times the user asks or enters again.

Includes use of headers, subroutines, functions, and variables.

Data input and output are performed correctly throughout the process.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING THE CODE CORRECTLY

Can be compiled in GDB and CODE BLOKS; For GDB the order is as follows:

Horoscope. h

Horoscope. c

main. c

(Deleting the 2 #include "Horoscope.h")

Or you can go back, open the "PIA" file and it all comes together.

And in CODE BLOKS you only need to add the 3 tabs.

It usually takes a while to compile so wait until It welcomes you.
