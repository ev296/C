/*Hello there!! Good that you are in my program, I hope you like it.
Can be compiled in GDB and CODE BLOKS; For GDB the order is as follows:
Horoscope. h
Horoscope. c
main. c
(Deleting the 2 #include "Horoscope.h")
Or you can go back, open the "PIA" file and it all comes together.

And in CODE BLOKS you only need to add the 3 tabs.

It usually takes a while to compile so wait until It welcomes you.
Luck!!
